4 years’ worth of money and time spent on relaxing my hair got me absolutely nowhere.When Littlefinger from Game of thrones said “Knowledge Is Power” he was right.I may not have had Rapunzel length relaxed hair if I avoided the relaxed hair mistakes I made years ago, but at least my hair wouldn’t have looked as terrible as it did then.I relaxed my hair on 2015 and up until early 2019, I had unhealthy, dry, weak, brown relaxed hair with a different length on the right side. So if I pulled it in a ponytail, the right side would stand up still like a soldier because it was shorter than the rest. That right side literally broke and gave up. When I look back, I laugh. Because how could I have grown long, thick and healthy relaxed hair with the way I was treating my hair? No wonder it gave up on me, I had already given up on it a long time ago. In this posts, I’m going to share with you 7 silly mistakes that destroyed my relaxed hair.Hopefully if you make them too, you’ll stop.Using different relaxers every time, I need to retouchMy hair is so kinky, it used to annoy me. Mostly because it coils very intensively that combing it would almost make me cry. At that time I had to idea what LOC methods were. That’s why I resorted to relaxing. I wanted my hair to be easy to comb.The downside with relaxing kinky hair like mine was getting the right relaxer to make it straight. I was told the kinkier your hair is, the intensive your relaxer should be. I didn’t want strong relaxers like TCB or Movit, the thought of it scared me, so I would choose lighter ones. The problem was. I thought relaxer was just relaxer. That it didn’t matter but it did. I changed relaxers so much, that when it finally came time that I settled and used only Mega growth relaxers the damage had already been doneDeep conditioning once in 3 monthsI honestly don’t remember the deep condition frequency because I rarely used to do it. I used to think washing my hair, letting it air dry then oiling my scalp would do the job and I’d go on like that for months especially when I didn’t get a weave on.It was a silly mistake because relaxed hair needs deep conditioning treatments because..Never moisturizingI was introduced to the term moisturizing in 2019. Before that? It was pretty much dry land, my hair was pretty much dry landBathing in my leave in conditionerWhenever I needed to go out, I’d slap my leave in conditioner on my dry hair and comb it, put it in a protective style and head out. Whch was every day of the week/ Using a lot of heatWhenever a blow dry suggestion came up at the salon, I said Protective styling? No thanksSleeping on cotton pillowcases
